## Introduction
Helmets are essential for protecting individuals in various activities such as sports, motorcycling, and construction. The Roll-off Test is a device designed to test the stability and safety of helmets, ensuring they remain securely in place during impact or sudden movements.

## Design Overview
The helmet testing device is meticulously designed using SolidWorks, a robust CAD software. The design includes various components that simulate real-world forces and impacts to evaluate the helmet's performance.

## Materials and Methods
- **Software Used**: SolidWorks
- **Key Components**: Testing rig, force sensors, and impact simulation tools
- **Testing Procedure**: Helmets are placed on a dummy head, subjected to forces from different angles to assess their stability and security.

## Results
The testing device successfully measures the helmet's ability to stay in place during sudden impacts and movements. The data collected helps in understanding the strengths and weaknesses of different helmet designs.

## Conclusion
The Roll-off Test provides valuable insights into helmet safety, contributing to the development of more secure and reliable helmets. This project underscores the importance of rigorous testing in ensuring personal safety equipment meets high standards.
